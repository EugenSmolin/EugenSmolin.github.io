                    In today’s fast-paced global business environment, possessing a comprehensive distribution chain is
                    vital to the survival of a business with an international customer base. Heightened demands
                    associated with shipping, customs, warehousing, inventory control, and distribution can and do take

                    vital link in our clients’ distribution chain, allowing them to free up more time to concentrate on
                    their business. We achieve this by using state-of-the-art integrated technology to provide
                    comprehensive logistics solutions for international freight, from shipping and customs clearance of
                    dangerous goods to warehousing, inventory control, and distribution using the latest Internet-based
                    systems.

                    The integrity of an import/export industry, especially with finished high-value goods, like
                    automobiles, depends heavily on the timely and responsible handling of their duties by every link in
                    the supply, acquisition, and delivery chain, with the processing facility playing a crucial role.TMM
                    International Company’s operational facility is a 100,000-square-foot site located in Perth Amboy,
